description: Use when a Monte Carlo Renormalization Group reproduction or calculation needs method-level route and tool selection — real-space block-spin RG on lattice spin models, extracting renormalized coupling constants and critical exponents from the eigenvalues of the RG Jacobian. Covers Swendsen's classic MCRG and the variational (bias-potential) MCRG that removes critical slowing down.

# Method MCRG

## Overview

MCRG computes the critical behavior of a classical spin model by repeatedly **coarsening the lattice and tracking how the model's interactions change.**

- **What it does.** The spins obey a Hamiltonian H — a set of interaction strengths (*coupling constants* K: nearest-neighbor, next-nearest, four-spin, …). Group the spins into blocks (e.g. 3×3), replace each block by one coarse spin via a fixed rule (usually majority vote); the coarse spins then obey an **effective Hamiltonian H′ with new couplings K′**. Repeating traces a flow K → K′ → K″ … in coupling space.
- **Target.** The renormalized couplings K′, and the **critical exponents** — read from how strongly K′ responds to a small change in K near the flow's stationary point.
- **What's approximated.** H′ exactly contains *infinitely many* couplings (blocking always generates new longer-range, multi-spin terms). The method **keeps a finite short-range set and discards the rest** — valid because dropped terms are short-range-small or irrelevant to the critical behavior. The number of couplings kept is the main accuracy knob.
- **General features.** Dimension-agnostic (block in any d; only the cost grows with d); applies to any classical spin model where you can sample configurations (and quantum models mapped to classical); needs only Monte-Carlo-sampled configurations; no sign problem.

**Two variants.** *Swendsen MCRG* reads exponents from Monte-Carlo-measured correlation functions without building H′ (truncation uncontrolled). *Variational MCRG* (this card's focus) builds the best H′ within the kept couplings by convex optimization — removing critical slowing down and making the truncation error estimable.

> **When this card is invoked, before any choice, orient the user in plain language (no jargon) with this table, filling the right column with *their* actual problem — their Hamiltonian, lattice, and setup. If those aren't fixed yet, use the table to elicit them; if the user has no specific problem in mind, fall back to 2D Ising (square, nearest-neighbor) as the illustration. Gloss each term on first use.**

| Ingredient | What it is | Your setup |
|---|---|---|
| Starting Hamiltonian H | the spin model's interaction strengths (couplings K) | *(user's model + couplings; default 2D Ising H = −K Σ⟨ij⟩ sᵢsⱼ)* |
| Coarse-graining | group spins into blocks, one coarse spin per block by a fixed rule | *(block size + rule; default 3×3 majority, b=3)* |
| Effective Hamiltonian H′ | the new couplings K′ the coarse spins obey | *(generated couplings to keep)* |
| Target | renormalized couplings + critical exponents | *(which exponents / couplings wanted)* |
| What's approximated | infinite generated couplings → keep a finite short-range set | *(how many couplings kept)* |
| Variant | Swendsen or Variational MCRG | *(which, and why)* |

## Select method — step 1

### Suited for
- Extracting **critical exponents** (thermal, magnetic, correction-to-scaling — from RG eigenvalues via y = ln λ / ln b) and **renormalized coupling constants** of lattice models at/near a critical fixed point.
- Real-space and configuration-based: works directly from Monte-Carlo-sampled configurations (the variational variant samples inside a bias-potential optimization).
- **Variational variant** when critical slowing down blocks large systems, or when you want the truncation error estimated.
- Validated mainly in **2D and 3D**; the formalism is dimension-general.

### Route elsewhere — when MCRG isn't the right tool

MCRG fits only when the target is **critical-point data** (exponents or renormalized couplings), or a quantum model mapped to classical.

> **When the user's goal falls outside this, interact by these principles:** recognize it before any setup; explain *what fits better and why* in a short table (what / why); use plain language, no jargon, precise and concise; stay warm — guide, don't dismiss.

### Options & trade-offs

| Variant | Good at | Weak at | When to use |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Variational MCRG** | no critical slowing down → large L near T_c; truncation error estimable; couplings + exponents from one convex optimization | extra bias-potential optimization to implement and tune | large systems near criticality, or when you want truncation control |
| **Swendsen MCRG** | simple, minimal code; textbook | critical slowing down at large L; truncation uncontrolled | small/moderate L; a quick exponent estimate; baseline/validation |

### Routing — surface to the user

> **When routing, present the choice to the user as a table** — precise, concise, plain language: which variant, when to choose it, and which fits their case. Draw the *why* from Options & trade-offs above, and make the user feel the one consequence that actually decides it: **critical slowing down** — on a large lattice near the critical point, Swendsen's sampling crawls and may never converge, while the variational bias keeps it fast — or, when reproducing, which variant the paper used. Don't decide silently; let them see the choice.

## Select software — step 2

### No canonical open-source code
There is **no canonical open-source code repository** for MCRG — the variational method's original code was never released, and no maintained package implements it. **Implement from scratch.** The algorithm lives in `## Details`; the primitives that express it live in `/using-jax`.

### Route — Python + JAX
The compute is a custom classical Monte Carlo (Metropolis/Wolff) sampling multiple walkers over many sweeps, plus stochastic optimization of the bias potential and a small Jacobian eigensolve. The two JAX features that matter:

- **`vmap`** — run the multiple walkers together in one vectorized pass.
- **`jit`** — compile the Metropolis/Wolff sweep so sampling is fast.

(Autodiff is *not* the reason for JAX — the optimization gradients are Monte Carlo estimators, not differentiated.)

### Surface to the user

> **Surface the software choice to the user — don't default silently.** In plain language, a short what/why table: (1) there's no off-the-shelf MCRG tool, so this is a **from-scratch build** — be honest about the cost (more code to write, and it must be validated against known/exact answers); (2) the route is **JAX**, because the work is sampling many walkers over many sweeps, which `vmap` + `jit` make fast — plain Python would crawl at large L. Even with no competing option, let the user feel *why* this is the deliberate choice, not an accident.

### Handoff
Invoke **/using-jax** once the route is fixed — it owns JAX CPU/GPU setup, jit/vmap/PRNG mechanics, and runtime troubleshooting. This card owns the algorithm (`## Details`), the operator basis, and the convergence plan.
