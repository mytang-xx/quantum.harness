# Method MCRG

## Overview

MCRG computes the critical behavior of a classical spin model by repeatedly **coarsening the lattice and tracking how the model's interactions change.**

- **What it does.** The spins obey a Hamiltonian H — a set of interaction strengths (*coupling constants* K: nearest-neighbor, next-nearest, four-spin, …). Group the spins into blocks (e.g. 3×3), replace each block by one coarse spin via a fixed rule (usually majority vote); the coarse spins then obey an **effective Hamiltonian H′ with new couplings K′**. Repeating traces a flow K → K′ → K″ … in coupling space.
- **Target.** The renormalized couplings K′, and the **critical exponents** — read from how strongly K′ responds to a small change in K near the flow's stationary point.
- **What's approximated.** H′ exactly contains *infinitely many* couplings (blocking always generates new longer-range, multi-spin terms). The method **keeps a finite short-range set and discards the rest** — valid because dropped terms are short-range-small or irrelevant to the critical behavior. The number of couplings kept is the main accuracy knob.
- **General features.** Dimension-agnostic (block in any d; only the cost grows with d); applies to any classical spin model where you can sample configurations (and quantum models mapped to classical); needs only Monte-Carlo-sampled configurations; no sign problem.

**Two variants.** *Swendsen MCRG* reads exponents from Monte-Carlo-measured correlation functions without building H′ (truncation uncontrolled). *Variational MCRG* (this card's focus) builds the best H′ within the kept couplings by convex optimization — removing critical slowing down and making the truncation error estimable.

> **When this card is invoked, before any choice, orient the user in plain language (no jargon) with this table, filling the right column with *their* actual problem — their Hamiltonian, lattice, and setup. If those aren't fixed yet, use the table to elicit them; if the user has no specific problem in mind, fall back to 2D Ising (square, nearest-neighbor) as the illustration. Gloss each term on first use.**

| Ingredient | What it is | Your setup |
|---|---|---|
| Starting Hamiltonian H | the spin model's interaction strengths (couplings K) | *(user's model + couplings; default 2D Ising H = −K Σ⟨ij⟩ sᵢsⱼ)* |
| Coarse-graining | group spins into blocks, one coarse spin per block by a fixed rule | *(block size + rule; default 3×3 majority, b=3)* |

### Route elsewhere — when MCRG isn't the right tool

MCRG fits only when the target is **critical-point data** (exponents or renormalized couplings), or a quantum model mapped to classical.

> **When the user's goal falls outside this, interact by these principles:** recognize it before any setup; explain *what fits better and why* in a short table (what / why); use plain language, no jargon, precise and concise; stay warm — guide, don't dismiss.

### Options & trade-offs

| Variant | Good at | Weak at | When to use |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Variational MCRG** | no critical slowing down → large L near T_c; truncation error estimable; couplings + exponents from one convex optimization | extra bias-potential optimization to implement and tune | large systems near criticality, or when you want truncation control |
| **Swendsen MCRG** | simple, minimal code; textbook | critical slowing down at large L; truncation uncontrolled | small/moderate L; a quick exponent estimate; baseline/validation |

### Routing — surface to the user

> **When routing, present the choice to the user as a table** — precise, concise, plain language: which variant, when to choose it, and which fits their case. Draw the *why* from Options & trade-offs above, and make the user feel the one consequence that actually decides it: **critical slowing down** — on a large lattice near the critical point, Swendsen's sampling crawls and may never converge, while the variational bias keeps it fast — or, when reproducing, which variant the paper used. Don't decide silently; let them see the choice.

## Select software — step 2

### No canonical open-source code
There is **no canonical open-source code repository** for MCRG — the variational method's original code was never released, and no maintained package implements it. **Implement from scratch.** The algorithm lives in `## Details`; the primitives that express it live in `/using-jax`.

### Route — Python + JAX
The compute is a custom classical Monte Carlo (Metropolis/Wolff) sampling multiple walkers over many sweeps, plus stochastic optimization of the bias potential and a small Jacobian eigensolve. The two JAX features that matter:

- **`vmap`** — run the multiple walkers together in one vectorized pass.
- **`jit`** — compile the Metropolis/Wolff sweep so sampling is fast.

(Autodiff is *not* the reason for JAX — the optimization gradients are Monte Carlo estimators, not differentiated.)

### Surface to the user

> **Surface the software choice to the user — don't default silently.** In plain language, a short what/why table: (1) there's no off-the-shelf MCRG tool, so this is a **from-scratch build** — be honest about the cost (more code to write, and it must be validated against known/exact answers); (2) the route is **JAX**, because the work is sampling many walkers over many sweeps, which `vmap` + `jit` make fast — plain Python would crawl at large L. Even with no competing option, let the user feel *why* this is the deliberate choice, not an accident.

### Handoff
Invoke **/using-jax** once the route is fixed — it owns JAX CPU/GPU setup, jit/vmap/PRNG mechanics, and runtime troubleshooting. This card owns the algorithm (`## Details`), the operator basis, and the convergence plan.

## Method setup — step 3

Each knob with its default and a consolidated principle/effect (with scaling where it matters). Defaults are the paper's 2D-Ising values — parenthesized where model/paper-specific; the principle transfers to other models. K_c = the critical coupling, where the exponents are defined. Software-side values (JAX device, JIT boundary) live in `/using-jax`. *(Math unicode/plain; surface as LaTeX on an app.)*

| Knob | Default | Principle, effect & scaling |
|---|---|---|
| **Block size & rule** | 3×3 majority rule, b=3 (Ising; ties random) | compose several small-b steps to a net rescaling b^n rather than one big block — fewer steps at fixed b^n means less accumulated truncation + finite-size error; the rule must respect the model's symmetry (majority for Ising; decimation proliferates couplings and fails) |
| **Operator basis & truncation** | 13 even (pruned from 26) + 5 odd chosen directly (Ising even/odd sectors) | start from a generous symmetry-allowed set, prune operators with small variational coefficient (\|coupling\| < 0.001), enlarge until the leading eigenvalues stop moving; the dominant accuracy lever — too few biases the exponents; optimization cost grows ~linearly in the number of coefficients; the residual p_V vs target gauges the truncation error |
| **Target distribution p_t** | uniform | choose p_t with analytic averages; uniform makes block spins uncorrelated → removes critical slowing down; p_t = the model's own block distribution recovers Swendsen (a Gaussian for continuous variables) |
| **Coarsening steps** | 5 per run + 1 preliminary (this paper) | enough steps to read the coupling flow; near a known K_c one step gives the Jacobian; each step compounds truncation + finite-size error; at K_c the couplings stay constant (the convergence signature) |
| **Sampling budget** | trajectory 3000→1240 steps, 20 sweeps/step, 16 walkers (this paper) | keep sweeps/step small — the trajectory averages per-step noise out; statistical error on the biased averages ~ 1/√samples and walker variance ~ 1/n_w, so lengthen the trajectory or add walkers to tighten the exponents |
| **Locating K_c** | K_c ≈ 0.436 (2D Ising, b=3; exact 0.4407) | bracket by the coupling flow direction — couplings grow above K_c, shrink below; a tighter bracket → more accurate exponents and lets one small-b step give the Jacobian; near K_c the optimization is noise-sensitive |
| **Optimizer** | averaged SGD (Bach–Moulines), µ = 5×10⁻⁵→5×10⁻⁶ (L-dependent) | build the bias from the running mean J̄, not instantaneous J; shrink µ as L grows for stability; reset the running mean at 10%/20% to drop its lag; averaged SGD converges ~ O(1/steps); stop at the J̄ plateau |
| **Spin update** | single-spin Metropolis | local Metropolis on σ under weight e^{−(H+V(τ(σ)))}; rely on the bias (not cluster moves) to kill the correlation time, which otherwise diverges as τ ~ ξ^z near T_c |

> **Confirm the setup with the user before running — one knob at a time, never batched. Required, not optional; never accept a silent default.** Open by sketching the algorithm idea in plain language (from Details → The idea) and tie each knob to its role in it — the bias potential V that flattens the block spins toward a uniform target (target distribution), the optimization of V (optimizer + sampling budget), the finite operator set retained (operator basis & truncation), the block map (block size & rule), and the fixed point where the exponents live (locating K_c) — so the user feels the algorithm and the setup together. Then, for each consequential knob, present the choice in Superpowers brainstorming style: 2–3 real options, each a one-line pro/con drawn from the Default and Principle columns above, the recommended option first and labeled "(Recommended)" when there is a technical reason (the paper's value when reproducing). Ask one question, wait for the answer, then move to the next — so the user feels each trade-off. The two that most decide the result: (1) **operator basis & truncation** — the accuracy lever; too few interactions bias the exponents, the fix is to enlarge until the leading eigenvalues stop moving; (2) **block size & rule** — a larger block needs fewer steps but costs more, and the rule must respect the model's symmetry (majority works; decimation fails).

### The idea

Near a critical point the coarse-grained (block-spin) distribution has a diverging correlation length, so sampling it directly suffers critical slowing down — the obstacle for standard MCRG. VMCRG sidesteps this: add a **bias potential V on the block spins** that forces their distribution to a simple **target p_t** (usually uniform → block spins uncorrelated → fast to sample).

The bias is found by minimizing a convex functional Ω[V] which — up to a V-independent constant — is the Kullback–Leibler divergence KL(p_t ‖ p_V) between the target and the biased block-spin distribution p_V. Minimizing it drives p_V → p_t.

The payoff is an identity: at the optimum, V_min = −H′ − log p_t + const, so for uniform p_t the **flattening bias is exactly minus the renormalized Hamiltonian**, H′ = −V_min. One convex optimization delivers both a fast, decorrelated sampler *and* the renormalized couplings K′_α = −J_min,α. (Reason: H′ is by definition −log of the block-spin distribution — an effective free energy — so a bias that cancels it to leave p_t must equal −H′ − log p_t.)

Two pieces make it practical:
- **Sampling without ever forming H′.** The biased average ⟨·⟩_V is sampled by ordinary Monte Carlo on the *fine* spins σ with weight e^{−H(σ)}·e^{−V(τ(σ))}; tracing out σ happens automatically, so the intractable partial trace defining H′ is never computed.
- **Exponents from the linearized map.** Differentiating the optimum condition w.r.t. the couplings gives the RG Jacobian ∂K′/∂K at K_c; its eigenvalues give the exponents (λ = b^y), split by spin-flip symmetry into even (thermal) and odd (magnetic).

Swendsen's classic MCRG is the **zero-bias corner**: take the target to be the model's own physical block distribution → V_min = 0 → Swendsen's formulae. A uniform target is the deliberate distortion that kills critical slowing down at no cost; the residual KL(p_t ‖ p_V) under a truncated basis is a built-in truncation-error monitor.

### Notation
- σ: fine spins; σ′ = τ(σ): block spins via block map τ; b: rescaling factor.
- H = Σ_α K_α S_α: Hamiltonian (operators S_α, couplings K_α); H′, K′_α: renormalized.
- V = Σ_α J_α S_α(σ′): bias potential; p_t: target; p_V ∝ e^{−(H′+V)}: biased block-spin distribution.
- Ω[V]: convex functional; ⟨·⟩_V: biased-ensemble average; ⟨·⟩_pt: target average; K_c: critical coupling.

### Algorithm

1. **Block transformation & exact effective Hamiltonian.** Choose σ′ = τ(σ) (e.g. 3×3 majority, b=3). The block-spin distribution is the constrained partial trace p(σ′) = (1/Z) Σ_σ δ(τ(σ),σ′) e^{−H(σ)} = e^{−H′(σ′)}/Z′ (2), Z′=Z, so H′(σ′) = −log Σ_σ δ(τ(σ),σ′) e^{−H(σ)} (4). H′ generically grows all symmetry-allowed operators (even products only, zero-field Ising); Eq 4 is intractable and never evaluated.

2. **Variational functional.** Ω[V] = log(Σ_σ′ e^{−[H′+V]} / Σ_σ′ e^{−H′}) + Σ_σ′ p_t V (5). Convex (first term is a log-partition); unique minimizer (up to a constant) gives H′ = −V_min − log p_t + const (6) and p_{V_min} = p_t (7).

3. **Parametrize, gradient, Hessian.** V_J = Σ_α J_α S_α(σ′) (8) → Ω convex in J. Gradient ∂Ω/∂J_α = −⟨S_α⟩_V + ⟨S_α⟩_pt (9) — target minus biased average; zero at the optimum (⇔ p_V = p_t). Hessian ⟨S_α S_β⟩_V − ⟨S_α⟩_V⟨S_β⟩_V (10) — connected covariance, PSD (convexity).

4. **The sampling crux.** Since V depends on σ only through σ′=τ(σ), e^{−V} pulls inside the trace: e^{−(H′+V)} = Σ_σ δ(τ(σ),σ′) e^{−H(σ)} e^{−V(τ(σ))}. So the biased block distribution is the marginal of the fine-spin distribution P(σ) ∝ e^{−H(σ)} e^{−V(τ(σ))}. **In practice:** run Metropolis on the *fine* spins σ with weight e^{−H}e^{−V(τ(σ))}; for any coarse operator, compute σ′=τ(σ) per sample and average. H′ and the partial trace are never formed. ⟨·⟩_pt is analytic for simple p_t (uniform → independent fair coins).

5. **Optimize.** Minimize Ω(J) by averaged SGD (Bach–Moulines): keep a running mean J̄ₙ = (1/n) Σ_i J^[i] and build the bias from it; update J^[n+1] = J^[n] − µ[Ω′(J̄) + Ω″(J̄)(J^[n] − J̄)] from noisy gradient (9)/Hessian (10), with multiple walkers cutting variance. Sweeps/step are small (noise averages out); reset the running mean at 10% and 20% of the trajectory to remove its lag; µ shrinks with L (5×10⁻⁵ → 5×10⁻⁶). Take J̄ at the plateau as J_min.

6. **Renormalized couplings & truncation.** With uniform p_t, K′_α = −J_min,α (11–12) — *mind the minus.* Drop operators with small |J_min,α| (variational truncation); gauge quality by the residual departure of p_{V_min} from p_t.

7. **Jacobian & exponents.** The optimum condition (9)=0 defines K′ implicitly as a function of K. Perturb K_β→K_β+δK_β; K′ responds by δK′. Linearizing (13→15) gives A_βγ = Σ_α (∂K′_α/∂K_β) B_αγ (15), with biased-ensemble connected correlations
   - A_βγ = ⟨S_β(σ) S_γ(σ′)⟩_V − ⟨S_β(σ)⟩_V⟨S_γ(σ′)⟩_V (16) — **fine** operator S_β(σ) vs **coarse** S_γ(σ′) (response to the bare coupling);
   - B_αγ = ⟨S_α(σ′) S_γ(σ′)⟩_V − ⟨S_α(σ′)⟩_V⟨S_γ(σ′)⟩_V (17) — two **coarse** operators (response to the renormalized coupling).

   Solve the linear system (15) for the Jacobian ∂K′/∂K (invert B); diagonalize. Eigenvalues give exponents via λ = b^y. Spin-flip symmetry block-diagonalizes the Jacobian into **even** (thermal → ν) and **odd** (magnetic) sectors — build A, B block-diagonally in parity. Setting the target to the unbiased block distribution makes V_min=0 and collapses (16–17) to **Swendsen's** formulae.

8. **Locate K_c and evaluate there.** Bracket K_c by the flow direction of the couplings across iterations (grow → ordered, shrink → disordered); at K_c they stay constant (paper: window 0.4355–0.4365, b=3; fixed at 0.436). Evaluate the Jacobian at K_c — e.g. couplings after iteration 1 = K_α, after iteration 2 = K′_α; an accurate K_c lets a single coarsening step suffice.
