# Method MCRG

## Overview

MCRG computes the critical behavior of a classical spin model by repeatedly **coarsening the lattice and tracking how the model's interactions change.**

- **What it does.** The spins obey a Hamiltonian H — a set of interaction strengths (*coupling constants* K: nearest-neighbor, next-nearest, four-spin, …). Group the spins into blocks (e.g. 3×3), replace each block by one coarse spin via a fixed rule (usually majority vote); the coarse spins then obey an **effective Hamiltonian H′ with new couplings K′**. Repeating traces a flow K → K′ → K″ … in coupling space.
- **Target.** The renormalized couplings K′, and the **critical exponents** — read from how strongly K′ responds to a small change in K near the flow's stationary point.
- **What's approximated.** H′ exactly contains *infinitely many* couplings (blocking always generates new longer-range, multi-spin terms). The method **keeps a finite short-range set and discards the rest** — valid because dropped terms are short-range-small or irrelevant to the critical behavior. The number of couplings kept is the main accuracy knob.
- **General features.** Dimension-agnostic (block in any d; only the cost grows with d); applies to any classical spin model where you can sample configurations (and quantum models mapped to classical); needs only Monte-Carlo-sampled configurations; no sign problem.

**Two variants.** *Swendsen MCRG* reads exponents from Monte-Carlo-measured correlation functions without building H′ (truncation uncontrolled). *Variational MCRG* (this card's focus) builds the best H′ within the kept couplings by convex optimization — removing critical slowing down and making the truncation error estimable.

> **When this card is invoked, before any choice, orient the user in plain language (no jargon) with this table, filling the right column with *their* actual problem — their Hamiltonian, lattice, and setup. If those aren't fixed yet, use the table to elicit them; if the user has no specific problem in mind, fall back to 2D Ising (square, nearest-neighbor) as the illustration. Gloss each term on first use.**

### Route elsewhere — when MCRG isn't the right tool

MCRG fits only when the target is **critical-point data** (exponents or renormalized couplings), or a quantum model mapped to classical.

> **When the user's goal falls outside this, interact by these principles:** recognize it before any setup; explain *what fits better and why* in a short table (what / why); use plain language, no jargon, precise and concise; stay warm — guide, don't dismiss.

### Options & trade-offs

| Variant | Good at | Weak at | When to use |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Variational MCRG** | no critical slowing down → large L near T_c; truncation error estimable; couplings + exponents from one convex optimization | extra bias-potential optimization to implement and tune | large systems near criticality, or when you want truncation control |
| **Swendsen MCRG** | simple, minimal code; textbook | critical slowing down at large L; truncation uncontrolled | small/moderate L; a quick exponent estimate; baseline/validation |

### Routing — surface to the user

> **When routing, present the choice to the user as a table** — precise, concise, plain language: which variant, when to choose it, and which fits their case. Draw the *why* from Options & trade-offs above, and make the user feel the one consequence that actually decides it: **critical slowing down** — on a large lattice near the critical point, Swendsen's sampling crawls and may never converge, while the variational bias keeps it fast — or, when reproducing, which variant the paper used. Don't decide silently; let them see the choice.

## Select software — step 2

### No canonical open-source code
There is **no canonical open-source code repository** for MCRG — the variational method's original code was never released, and no maintained package implements it. **Implement from scratch.** The algorithm lives in `## Details`; the primitives that express it live in `/using-jax`.

### Route — Python + JAX
The compute is a custom classical Monte Carlo (Metropolis/Wolff) sampling multiple walkers over many sweeps, plus stochastic optimization of the bias potential and a small Jacobian eigensolve. The two JAX features that matter:

- **`vmap`** — run the multiple walkers together in one vectorized pass.
- **`jit`** — compile the Metropolis/Wolff sweep so sampling is fast.

(Autodiff is *not* the reason for JAX — the optimization gradients are Monte Carlo estimators, not differentiated.)

### Surface to the user

> **Surface the software choice to the user — don't default silently.** In plain language, a short what/why table: (1) there's no off-the-shelf MCRG tool, so this is a **from-scratch build** — be honest about the cost (more code to write, and it must be validated against known/exact answers); (2) the route is **JAX**, because the work is sampling many walkers over many sweeps, which `vmap` + `jit` make fast — plain Python would crawl at large L. Even with no competing option, let the user feel *why* this is the deliberate choice, not an accident.

### Handoff
Invoke **/using-jax** once the route is fixed — it owns JAX CPU/GPU setup, jit/vmap/PRNG mechanics, and runtime troubleshooting. This card owns the algorithm (`## Details`), the operator basis, and the convergence plan.

## Method setup — step 3

Conceptual knobs and the trick behind each. Values are from 1707.08683 (2D Ising, square). Software-side values (JAX device, JIT boundary) live in `/using-jax`. *(Math is unicode/plain per AGENTS.md; surface it as LaTeX on an app, plain in a terminal.)*

| Knob | Controls | Value in the paper | Trick / effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Block size & rule** | the rescaling factor b (linear shrink per step) and how each block maps to one coarse spin | 3×3 majority rule (b=3); also 2×2, 16×16 | larger b → fewer coarsening steps, less accumulated truncation + finite-size error, but costlier; majority rule = sign of the block's spin sum; decimation-type rules proliferate couplings and fail |
| **Operator basis & truncation** | which interaction terms the renormalized (coarse) Hamiltonian is expanded in, and how many are kept | 26 initial → keep 13 even (7 two-spin + 6 four-spin) for the thermal eigenvalue + 5 odd (1 one-spin + 4 three-spin) for the magnetic eigenvalue; drop any renormalized coupling below 0.001 after one preliminary step | dominant accuracy lever; the drop is variational — a near-zero optimized coefficient flags an unimportant operator; too small a basis biases the exponents, so enlarge until the leading eigenvalues converge |
| **Target distribution** | the block-spin distribution the bias potential forces | uniform (flat) | a uniform target decorrelates the block spins → removes critical slowing down (sampling stalls near the critical point); also makes the target-side averages analytic and lets the renormalized couplings be read straight off the optimized bias |
| **Coarsening steps** | number of successive coarse-grainings per run | 5 (+1 preliminary to set the truncation) | deeper flow vs accumulating per-step error; all steps reuse the initial lattice |
| **Sampling budget** | the Monte Carlo effort behind each optimization step | trajectory of 3000 steps (L=45) → 1240 (L=300) × 20 sweeps/step × 16 walkers (independent parallel runs); ~10⁶ sweeps total, 5×10⁵ at L=300 | more walkers lower the variance of the biased averages; sweeps/step are kept small on purpose — the per-step noise averages out over the trajectory |
| **Locating the critical coupling K_c** | K_c — the coupling at which the system is exactly critical (the fixed point where couplings stop flowing), where the exponents are defined | bracket 0.4355–0.4365 (b=3); fix K_c=0.436 | bracket by the flow direction of the renormalized couplings (grow → ordered, shrink → disordered); at K_c they stay constant; an accurate K_c lets a single coarsening step give the Jacobian |
| **Optimizer** | the stochastic minimization of the bias potential's (convex) cost function | averaged SGD (Bach–Moulines); step size µ = 5×10⁻⁵ (L=45) → 5×10⁻⁶ (L=300); running mean reset at 10% and 20% of the trajectory | averaged SGD tolerates the MC noise in the gradient (9) and Hessian (10); µ shrinks with L for stability; convergence is judged by the running-average plateau |
| **Spin update** | the Monte Carlo move sampling the biased ensemble | Metropolis | local updates suffice — the bias potential, not cluster moves, removes critical slowing down |

> **Surface the consequential knobs to the user loudly, not silently.** Two decide the result and must be felt: (1) the **operator basis & truncation** — the main accuracy lever; keeping too few interactions biases the exponents, and the fix is to enlarge the set until the leading eigenvalues stop moving; (2) the **block size & rule** — a larger block needs fewer coarsening steps but costs more, and the rule must be sensible (majority works; decimation-type rules fail). Present each with its consequence and the paper's value, and let the user choose.

### The idea

Near a critical point the coarse-grained (block-spin) distribution has a diverging correlation length, so sampling it directly suffers critical slowing down — the obstacle for standard MCRG. VMCRG sidesteps this: add a **bias potential V on the block spins** that forces their distribution to a simple **target p_t** (usually uniform → block spins uncorrelated → fast to sample).

The bias is found by minimizing a convex functional Ω[V] which — up to a V-independent constant — is the Kullback–Leibler divergence KL(p_t ‖ p_V) between the target and the biased block-spin distribution p_V. Minimizing it drives p_V → p_t.

The payoff is an identity: at the optimum, V_min = −H′ − log p_t + const, so for uniform p_t the **flattening bias is exactly minus the renormalized Hamiltonian**, H′ = −V_min. One convex optimization delivers both a fast, decorrelated sampler *and* the renormalized couplings K′_α = −J_min,α. (Reason: H′ is by definition −log of the block-spin distribution — an effective free energy — so a bias that cancels it to leave p_t must equal −H′ − log p_t.)

Two pieces make it practical:
- **Sampling without ever forming H′.** The biased average ⟨·⟩_V is sampled by ordinary Monte Carlo on the *fine* spins σ with weight e^{−H(σ)}·e^{−V(τ(σ))}; tracing out σ happens automatically, so the intractable partial trace defining H′ is never computed.
- **Exponents from the linearized map.** Differentiating the optimum condition w.r.t. the couplings gives the RG Jacobian ∂K′/∂K at K_c; its eigenvalues give the exponents (λ = b^y), split by spin-flip symmetry into even (thermal) and odd (magnetic).

Swendsen's classic MCRG is the **zero-bias corner**: take the target to be the model's own physical block distribution → V_min = 0 → Swendsen's formulae. A uniform target is the deliberate distortion that kills critical slowing down at no cost; the residual KL(p_t ‖ p_V) under a truncated basis is a built-in truncation-error monitor.

### Notation

- H = Σ_α K_α S_α: Hamiltonian (operators S_α, couplings K_α); H′, K′_α: renormalized.
- V = Σ_α J_α S_α(σ′): bias potential; p_t: target; p_V ∝ e^{−(H′+V)}: biased block-spin distribution.

### Algorithm

1. **Block transformation & exact effective Hamiltonian.** Choose σ′ = τ(σ) (e.g. 3×3 majority, b=3). The block-spin distribution is the constrained partial trace p(σ′) = (1/Z) Σ_σ δ(τ(σ),σ′) e^{−H(σ)} = e^{−H′(σ′)}/Z′ (2), Z′=Z, so H′(σ′) = −log Σ_σ δ(τ(σ),σ′) e^{−H(σ)} (4). H′ generically grows all symmetry-allowed operators (even products only, zero-field Ising); Eq 4 is intractable and never evaluated.

2. **Variational functional.** Ω[V] = log(Σ_σ′ e^{−[H′+V]} / Σ_σ′ e^{−H′}) + Σ_σ′ p_t V (5). Convex (first term is a log-partition); unique minimizer (up to a constant) gives H′ = −V_min − log p_t + const (6) and p_{V_min} = p_t (7).

3. **Parametrize, gradient, Hessian.** V_J = Σ_α J_α S_α(σ′) (8) → Ω convex in J. Gradient ∂Ω/∂J_α = −⟨S_α⟩_V + ⟨S_α⟩_pt (9) — target minus biased average; zero at the optimum (⇔ p_V = p_t). Hessian ⟨S_α S_β⟩_V − ⟨S_α⟩_V⟨S_β⟩_V (10) — connected covariance, PSD (convexity).

4. **The sampling crux.** Since V depends on σ only through σ′=τ(σ), e^{−V} pulls inside the trace: e^{−(H′+V)} = Σ_σ δ(τ(σ),σ′) e^{−H(σ)} e^{−V(τ(σ))}. So the biased block distribution is the marginal of the fine-spin distribution P(σ) ∝ e^{−H(σ)} e^{−V(τ(σ))}. **In practice:** run Metropolis on the *fine* spins σ with weight e^{−H}e^{−V(τ(σ))}; for any coarse operator, compute σ′=τ(σ) per sample and average. H′ and the partial trace are never formed. ⟨·⟩_pt is analytic for simple p_t (uniform → independent fair coins).

5. **Optimize.** Minimize Ω(J) by averaged SGD (Bach–Moulines): keep a running mean J̄ₙ = (1/n) Σ_i J^[i] and build the bias from it; update J^[n+1] = J^[n] − µ[Ω′(J̄) + Ω″(J̄)(J^[n] − J̄)] from noisy gradient (9)/Hessian (10), with multiple walkers cutting variance. Sweeps/step are small (noise averages out); reset the running mean at 10% and 20% of the trajectory to remove its lag; µ shrinks with L (5×10⁻⁵ → 5×10⁻⁶). Take J̄ at the plateau as J_min.

6. **Renormalized couplings & truncation.** With uniform p_t, K′_α = −J_min,α (11–12) — *mind the minus.* Drop operators with small |J_min,α| (variational truncation); gauge quality by the residual departure of p_{V_min} from p_t.

7. **Jacobian & exponents.** The optimum condition (9)=0 defines K′ implicitly as a function of K. Perturb K_β→K_β+δK_β; K′ responds by δK′. Linearizing (13→15) gives A_βγ = Σ_α (∂K′_α/∂K_β) B_αγ (15), with biased-ensemble connected correlations
   - A_βγ = ⟨S_β(σ) S_γ(σ′)⟩_V − ⟨S_β(σ)⟩_V⟨S_γ(σ′)⟩_V (16) — **fine** operator S_β(σ) vs **coarse** S_γ(σ′) (response to the bare coupling);
   - B_αγ = ⟨S_α(σ′) S_γ(σ′)⟩_V − ⟨S_α(σ′)⟩_V⟨S_γ(σ′)⟩_V (17) — two **coarse** operators (response to the renormalized coupling).

   Solve the linear system (15) for the Jacobian ∂K′/∂K (invert B); diagonalize. Eigenvalues give exponents via λ = b^y. Spin-flip symmetry block-diagonalizes the Jacobian into **even** (thermal → ν) and **odd** (magnetic) sectors — build A, B block-diagonally in parity. Setting the target to the unbiased block distribution makes V_min=0 and collapses (16–17) to **Swendsen's** formulae.

8. **Locate K_c and evaluate there.** Bracket K_c by the flow direction of the couplings across iterations (grow → ordered, shrink → disordered); at K_c they stay constant (paper: window 0.4355–0.4365, b=3; fixed at 0.436). Evaluate the Jacobian at K_c — e.g. couplings after iteration 1 = K_α, after iteration 2 = K′_α; an accurate K_c lets a single coarsening step suffice.
