# Transverse-Field Ising

Solve transverse-field Ising ground-state problems. Lattice and `Γ/J` ratio determine method choice and what physics is accessible.

## Diagnose

Infer setup from the user's prompt and propose for ratification.

**Canonical defaults:** 1D chain, ferromagnetic J=1, Γ=1 (critical point), OBC, N=20, target E/N + gap.

**Proposal pattern:** "Going with: 1D chain, J=1, Γ=1 (critical), OBC, N=20, target E/N and gap. Override any, or pick: Γ/J scan (phase diagram), 2D square lattice."

Build per `.knowledge/conventions.md`: `H = -J Σ σ^z_i σ^z_j - Γ Σ σ^x_i`.

## Workflow

1. Set up sites (Z2 symmetry sector, parity) and Hamiltonian per conventions.
2. Pick method per the table.
3. First short run; verify the parity sector and that the calculation respects Z2 if no field-breaking term is present.
4. Sweep convergence parameter until the target observable stabilizes.
5. Verify (next section).
6. If the target is critical behavior, hand off to `criticality`.

## Method recommendations

| Regime | Method | Card |
|---|---|---|
| 1D chain (any N) | DMRG | `.knowledge/methods/mps-based-algorithm.md` |
| Tiny cluster (N ≲ 24), exact spectrum, debugging | ED pending refreshed references | `.knowledge/methods/ed/METHOD.md` |
| Cylinder (square / triangular strips) | DMRG | `.knowledge/methods/mps-based-algorithm.md` |
| Imaginary-time approach | TEBD | `.knowledge/methods/mps-based-algorithm.md` |

## Branch table

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| Question is about quantum critical behavior at `Γ ≈ J` (1D) or the equivalent transition | Run the calculation here, then call `criticality`. |
| Question is about magic / SRE / nonstabilizerness / Pauli weight (any dimension) | Run the wavefunction here; hand off to `.knowledge/physics/magic/PHYSICS.md`. For 1D, the standard partition is `L(ρ_AB)` (peaks at `h_c = 1`, log-`L` growth at criticality); for 2D, the standard estimator is `m_1` (crossing at the confinement-deconfinement transition; see `confinement` row). See `.knowledge/magic-benchmarks.md`. |
| Question is about confinement / deconfinement (2D `Z_2` lattice gauge theory ↔ 2D Ising via Wegner duality) | Run on the dual 2D Ising here (Wegner duality preserves SREs and the magic-crossing diagnostic — see `.knowledge/magic-conventions.md`); hand off to `.knowledge/physics/confinement/PHYSICS.md`. |
| Long-range Ising (e.g., `1/r^α`) | Stay here; flag that bond dimension grows; document. |
| User asks about dynamics | Out of current scope. |
| User asks about finite-T | Out of current scope. |

## Verification

Default checks (all auto-run; results aggregated into the report's verification line):

- **Limit checks** via `.knowledge/limits.md`:
  - 1D: at `Γ = 0`, ground state is a classical Ising ferromagnet (or antiferromagnet) with energy `E/N = -J z / 2` (`z` = coordination); at `J = 0`, ground state is fully polarized along `x` with `E/N = -Γ`.
  - 2D: at `h ≪ J`, ground state is the all-aligned ferromagnet `|↑…↑⟩` (a +1 eigenstate of all `σ^z`, hence a stabilizer state); at `h ≫ J`, ground state is the all-aligned paramagnet `|+…+⟩` (a +1 eigenstate of all `σ^x`, also a stabilizer state). Both endpoints have `m_n → 0` analytically when magic is the observable; energy limits track the dominant single-site contribution. The 2D `m_n(h)` crossing sits between these two stabilizer endpoints; failure at either endpoint is upstream of the crossing diagnostic.
- **Symmetry**: Z2 (`σ^z → -σ^z`) should be respected; spontaneous breaking shows only with explicit symmetry-breaking field at finite size.
- **Convergence**: bond-dim sweep gives a monotonic, asymptoting energy curve.
- **Internal consistency**: energy variance small relative to E².
- **Cross-method validation (auto-paired when available)** — use TEBD, DMRG, or TTN cross-checks first. Use ED only after `.knowledge/methods/ed/METHOD.md` is rebuilt.

Optional check:

- Compare to `.knowledge/benchmark-numbers.md` for canonical lattices when a reference exists. For 1D chain at criticality (`Γ = J`): exact `E/N = -4/π ≈ -1.2732` (free-fermion via Jordan-Wigner; convention-dependent).
- For magic / SRE observables on 2D variants, see `.knowledge/magic-benchmarks.md` for the literature ranges including the explicit 2D endpoint limit-check rows.

## Writeup handoff

After verification, if the user wants to communicate the result, consolidate to a runnable script + short run report, then route to `scientific-writing` / `scientific-visualization`. See AGENTS.md "Writeup handoff".
