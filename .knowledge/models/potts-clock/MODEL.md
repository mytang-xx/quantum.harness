# Potts / Clock

Solve `q`-state quantum Potts and quantum Clock ground-state problems. Generic over `q`. The 1D `q = 3` Clock model is also the quantum 3-state Potts model (after the standard duality), with critical `Z_3` parafermion CFT at `c = 4/5`. Higher `q` extends the family; `q = 2` reduces to the transverse-field Ising chain (use `transverse-field-ising` for that).

## Diagnose

Infer the canonical setup from the user's prompt and propose it for ratification.

**Canonical defaults:** 1D chain, `q = 3` (Clock = 3-state Potts), ferromagnetic, `h` on the user's prompt (default critical point `h_c = 1`), PBC ring (preferred for criticality work; OBC available), target `m_1` magic density across `h` or order-parameter scan. Local Hilbert dimension `d = q`.

**Proposal pattern:** "Going with: 1D chain, `q = 3` Clock (= 3-state Potts), `h`-scan around `h_c = 1`, PBC ring, `L = 32`, target `m_1(h)` and `Z_q` order parameter. Override any, or pick: different `q` (e.g., `q = 4`), 2D square, full criticality scan."

Build per `.knowledge/conventions.md` (default sign / coupling) and `.knowledge/magic-conventions.md` (qudit Pauli operators / clock-shift definitions). The Hamiltonian is

```
H = − Σ_{⟨ij⟩} (X_i X_j^† + X_i^† X_j) − h Σ_i (Z_i + Z_i^†)
```

with `X, Z` the qudit shift / clock operators (`X|k⟩ = |k+1 mod q⟩`, `Z|k⟩ = ω_q^k |k⟩`, `ω_q = e^{2πi/q}`).

## Workflow

1. Set up sites with local dimension `d = q`; pin sector via `Z_q` quantum number (the symmetry generator is `Π_i Z_i`; conserve where the stack supports it).
2. Pick method per the table.
3. Short first run; verify the `Z_q` sector and the parity / clock symmetry expected from the input.
4. Sweep convergence parameter (bond dim or basis size) until the target observable stabilizes.
5. Verify (next section).
6. If the target is criticality, hand off to `criticality`; if the target is magic, hand off to `magic`.

## Method recommendations

| Regime | Method | Card |
|---|---|---|
| 1D chain, any `q`, ground-state energy + standard observables | DMRG (qudit MPS) | `.knowledge/methods/mps-based-algorithm.md` |
| 1D chain at large `N` with magic / Pauli-string sampling | MPS Based Algorithm | `.knowledge/methods/mps-based-algorithm.md` |
| Tiny cluster (`N ≲ 16` for `q = 3`), exact spectrum | ED pending refreshed references | `.knowledge/methods/ed/METHOD.md` |
| 2D square (small clusters / cylinders) | DMRG cylinder | `.knowledge/methods/mps-based-algorithm.md` |
| Imaginary-time route to ground state | TEBD | `.knowledge/methods/mps-based-algorithm.md` |

## Branch table

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| `q = 2` | Switch to `transverse-field-ising` — same physics, simpler stack. |
| Question is about the FM/PM critical point (universality class, exponents) | Run the calculation here, then call `criticality`. The 1D `q = 3` critical point is `Z_3` parafermion CFT, `c = 4/5`, `ν_Potts = 5/6` (limit anchor). |
| Question is about magic / SRE / nonstabilizerness | Run the wavefunction here; hand off to `magic`. Two-site Pauli-flip updates required to preserve `Z_q` symmetry. |
| 2D square, large `q`, exotic phase content | Beyond current scope for systematic ground-state work; surface uncertainty. |
| Lattice is non-square (triangular Potts, etc.) | Stay here; flag that the universality class differs from the 1D Clock case. Call `frustration` if relevant. |

## Verification

Default checks (all auto-run; results aggregated into the report's verification line):

- **Limit checks** via `.knowledge/limits.md` and analytic limits of the Clock Hamiltonian: `h = 0` ⇒ `q`-fold-degenerate ferromagnetic ground state with `E/N = −2` (sum over both `(X X† + X† X)` directions); `h → ∞` ⇒ paramagnetic, `E/N = −2 h` (clock-aligned along the field direction); `q = 2` ⇒ recovers TFIM exactly.
- **Symmetry**: `Z_q` symmetry (`Π_i Z_i`) respected; ground state in the trivial sector for finite `L` with no symmetry-breaking field.
- **Convergence**: bond-dim or basis-size sweep gives a monotonic, asymptoting energy curve. Auto-saved convergence plot per AGENTS.md output norm.
- **Internal consistency**: energy variance small relative to `E²`.
- **Cross-method validation (auto-paired when available)** — use DMRG / TTN cross-checks first. Use ED only after `.knowledge/methods/ed/METHOD.md` is rebuilt.

Optional check:

- For `q = 3` 1D Clock at `h_c = 1`: the critical exponent `ν_Potts = 5/6` from CFT is the limit anchor (`.knowledge/magic-benchmarks.md`). When extracting `ν` from a finite-size collapse, compare to the analytic value, not to a numerical extrapolation. Per AGENTS.md verification rule §6, compare against the literature *range* (`ν ∈ [0.83, 0.85]`), which brackets both the analytic value and the methodology reference's `ν ≈ 0.844`.

## Frontier flag

`q ≥ 5` quantum Potts models in 1D have a first-order transition rather than a continuous one; the framing is different from the canonical `q ∈ {2, 3, 4}` continuous-transition story. State the regime explicitly and route to `criticality` for the order-of-transition diagnostic.

## Branch table (magic and related)

| Diagnostic | Action |
|---|---|
| `magic` | Hand off to `.knowledge/physics/magic/PHYSICS.md`. Two-site Pauli-flip updates preserve `Z_q` symmetry; `L(ρ_AB)` is the recommended critical diagnostic. Benchmark anchor: `ν_Potts = 5/6` from `.knowledge/magic-benchmarks.md`. |
| `criticality` | Standard finite-size scaling on the order parameter, gap, or magic. The 1D `q = 3` critical point is `c = 4/5` parafermion CFT. |
| `confinement` | Not the canonical framing for Potts/Clock at the FM/PM transition (no gauge interpretation); skip unless the user is in an extended-coupling regime that genuinely raises a confinement question. |

## Writeup handoff

After verification, if the user wants to communicate the result, consolidate to a runnable script + short run report, then route to `scientific-writing` / `scientific-visualization`. See AGENTS.md "Writeup handoff".
