# quantum.harness

A student-facing quantum many-body research harness. It helps an AI agent choose a method, write runnable code, run the calculation, and verify the result.

Each method is curated by world-leading experts in that computational approach, so the guidance reflects real research practice: what to compute, which checks matter, and where common failures happen.

## What The Harness Provides

- Model and physics cards with Hamiltonians, conventions, phases, and known limits.
- Method cards with algorithm choices, setup guidance, and verification checks.
- Skills such as `/onboard`, `/reproduce-paper`, `/solve`, `/parameter-scan`, and `/survey`.
- Generated scripts under `scripts/` and outputs under `results/`.
- Cluster support for calculations too large for a laptop.


## Start Here

If you do not yet have Claude Code, Codex CLI, or OpenCode installed, follow the
[summer-school agent setup guide](https://giggleliu.github.io/summer-school-2026/guide#setup)
first.

Paste this into Claude Code, Codex, or OpenCode:

```text
Clone https://github.com/QuantumBFS/quantum.harness.
Run `make skills` to install the harness skills.
Then run `/track-starter` to help me understand a method by reproducing a paper.
```

## Numeric Methods for Quantum Systems

Each method is curated by world-leading experts in that computational approach. Each method folder contains the starting point for students, including the target problem, recommended stack, and verification expectations.
