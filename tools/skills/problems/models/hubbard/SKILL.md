# Hubbard

Solve Hubbard ground-state problems as correlated-electron tasks. Doping, extended terms (`t'`, `V`), lattice, and DMFT-style embedding are all workflow choices inside this problem — not separate skills.

## Diagnose

- **Lattice and dimension** (chain, square default for 2D).
- **Filling** or sector `(N↑, N↓)`. Half-filled: `N↑ = N↓ = N/2`.
- **`U/t` ratio**.
- **Hopping range**: just nearest-neighbor or also `t'`, `t2`?
- **Extended interactions**: `V_1`, `V_2` density-density terms, if any.
- **Boundary condition / cylinder shape**.
- **Target observable**: `E/N`, double occupancy `⟨n↑ n↓⟩`, spin/charge correlations, gap, magnetic order parameter.

Build per `knowledge-base/conventions.md`:
`H = -t Σ_<ij>,σ (c†_iσ c_jσ + h.c.) + U Σ_i n_i↑ n_i↓` (extend with `t'`, `V` as needed).

## Workflow

1. Set up sites with `(N↑, N↓)` conservation; choose initial state in target sector.
2. Pick method per the table.
3. First short run; verify particle/spin numbers, particle-hole at half-filling, fermionic signs.
4. Sweep convergence parameter; track observable.
5. Verify (next section).
6. If the question becomes a Mott / large-U / multi-orbital question, hand off.

## Method recommendations

| Regime | Method | Card |
|---|---|---|
| Small cluster (N ≲ 16 sites) | ED | `knowledge-base/methods/ed.md` |
| 1D chain, ladder, narrow cylinder | DMRG | `knowledge-base/methods/dmrg.md` |
| Imaginary-time route to ground state | TEBD | `knowledge-base/methods/tebd.md` |
| Half-filled bipartite at moderate `U` | AFQMC may be sign-free; recommend only after checking. | — |
| Local self-energy / Mott transition framing | DMFT — out of current scope unless an install target lands; surface explicitly. | — |

## Branch table

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| `U/t ≫ 1` and finite hole density | Switch to `t-j` (faithful large-U reduction with `J = 4t²/U`). |
| Question is about Mott localization, double occupancy, charge gap | Call `mott-transition`. |
| Multiple orbitals or Hund's coupling | Switch to `multiorbital-hubbard`. |
| Question is about quantum critical behavior (e.g., Mott QCP) | Call `criticality` after the calculation. |
| Frustrated lattice (triangular Hubbard, etc.) | Call `frustration`. |

## Verification

Default checks:

- **Limit checks** via `knowledge-base/limits.md`: `U = 0` → free fermions on lattice (compute analytically); `U → ∞` half-filled bipartite → Heisenberg AFM with `J = 4t²/U`; atomic limit `t = 0` → trivial occupation.
- **Symmetry**: `(N↑, N↓)` conservation; SU(2) for `H_Hubbard` with no field; particle-hole symmetry at half-filling on bipartite lattices.
- **Convergence**: bond-dim sweep + cylinder-width when 2D.
- **Internal consistency**: variance, double-occupancy trend (decreases with `U/t`), spin-spin correlations build up at large `U`.

Optional check:

- 1D chain at half-filling: compare to Lieb-Wu integral equations (`knowledge-base/benchmark-numbers.md`). For 2D, the field is contested at intermediate `U` and finite doping — report values with their convergence trend rather than claiming a benchmark.
