name: verify
description: Use when an important artifact needs independent audit, or when a reproduction gate fails and needs mismatch triage — artifacts include protocol TOML, run plan, reproduction script, computed result, figure, final run report, KB card; trigger phrases like "verify this", "audit this", "review this gate", "why did the gate fail?".

# verify

<role>
Dispatcher that audits an artifact against its declared reference. Generic over artifact type — the same mechanism applies to seven artifact families (modes below). Pick the matching mode; per-mode axes are the contract. The subagent reads both sources end-to-end and returns a structured diff report. Never modifies anything.

Audit dispatch contract: see AGENTS.md → Audit dispatch.
</role>

## When to activate

- After writing or editing a `protocol.toml`, KB card, reproduction entry, or run report.
- After producing a result, figure, or artifact bundle.
- Before claiming a reproduction complete; before merging a KB-card edit.
- When a flow gate fails (`flow check` shows failures) — use `mismatch` mode.

## Inputs

- `<artifact>` — file path of the artifact under review.
- `--against <reference>` — optional. Auto-inferred when obvious.
- `--mode <protocol | plan | kb-card | script | result | mismatch | close>` — selector; picked from artifact extension + content when absent.

| Mode | Use when | Detailed axes |
|---|---|---|
| `protocol` | Auditing `protocol.toml` against declared primary sources. | [protocol axes ↓](#protocol) |
| `plan` | Auditing `reproduce-plan.toml` / `run_spec.json` against the protocol. | [plan axes ↓](#plan) |
| `kb-card` | Auditing a KB card's anchors against literature. | [kb-card axes ↓](#kb-card) |
| `script` | Auditing a reproduction script against the protocol and methodology. | [script axes ↓](#script) |
| `result` | Auditing produced numerical and figure results against declared references. | [result axes ↓](#result) |
| `mismatch` | Triaging a failed gate. | [mismatch axes ↓](#mismatch) |
| `close` | Auditing the final run report / declared entry / manifests. | [close axes ↓](#close) |

## Dispatch

Audit dispatch contract: see AGENTS.md → Audit dispatch. Record the returned subagent id/name as `reviewer`.

The verifier brief includes the following verbatim lines:

<brief>
Think deeply. Inspect both sources end-to-end before reporting; avoid skim-based conclusions.

You are independent from the author. Treat author comments and summaries as claims to check, not evidence.

Coverage, not filtering. Report every finding, including uncertain or minor ones. Mark verdicts conservatively (prefer ✗ over rationalized near-matches). The calling skill ranks; do not pre-filter.

Output the per-axis status table. Do not write Action items or fixes — that is the calling skill's job.
</brief>

Assemble the brief by concatenating: `<brief verbatim/>` + the per-mode axes for `<mode>` + the artifact and reference excerpts (verbatim artifact + verbatim reference, or precise line range).

Minimum context bundle: the artifact, the primary source (or exact excerpts), the current `protocol.toml` when the artifact is downstream of it, and the exact question (which claim, gate, or mismatch is being audited).

## Per-mode axes

### `kb-card`

Per AGENTS.md provenance discipline.

1. **Literal** — check by: grep the cited literature file for the verbatim phrase. ✓ with line number, ✗ unsupported, ⚠ near-match.
2. **Analytic** — check by: row states a derivation. ✓ if stated, ⚠ if unstated.
3. **Harness anchor** — check by: row names a `results/` path and cross-check method. ✓ if both, ⚠ if either missing.
4. **Untagged** — check by: any anchor row missing one of the three tags above. ✗.

### `protocol`

Compare the protocol against declared primary sources.

1. **Source authority** — only `primary` rows support paper-derived claims; `hint` rows require an explicit assumption flag.
2. **Claim support** — each claim cites a primary passage or is marked `assumption=true`.
3. **Check coverage** — each non-assumption claim is covered by ≥1 `[[checks]]` entry or by a justified deviation.
4. **Generic check shape** — checks use one of the eight kinds: `audit`, `run`, `exists`, `agree`, `near`, `fresh`, `cover`, `support`; ids are unique override handles. No paper-specific or domain-specific kind names.
5. **Cell routes** — every executable cell declares `method`, `stack`, `route`, `source`, `check`, `state`, and `scope`; `route` is `paper`, `canonical`, `fallback`, or `deviation`.
6. **Route authority** — `paper` routes cite primary / official sources, `canonical` routes cite a method card or stack card, `fallback` routes cite the method card's next recommended fallback stack, and `deviation` routes cite a deviation id before compute. Generic installed libraries are not fallback authority. Empty, failed, or skipped route state blocks compute unless scoped as a declared deviation or pending item.
7. **Deviation clarity** — declared differences from the paper are scoped, claim-tagged, and have their own checks.
8. **Repair clarity** — post-failure or contract-changing edits have `[[repairs]]` rows with `from`, `wrong`, `changed`, `invalidate`, and `state`.
9. **Gate completeness** — every gate the flow template declares has checks sufficient to prevent stale or unsupported artifacts from passing.

Severity tags (non-exhaustive): `supported`, `unsupported`, `hint-leak`, `assumption`, `deviation`, `repair`, `missing-check`, `missing-route`, `unsupported-route`, `non-generic`.

### `plan`

Compare `reproduce-plan.toml` and `run_spec.json` against the protocol and methodology source.

1. **Claim-to-route coverage** — every non-assumption claim has an executable `cell` route, artifact target, and check.
2. **Figure dependency graph** — shared artifacts and edges consistent with the protocol.
3. **Run-spec provenance** — cells carry source ids, claim ids, deviation ids, method, stack, route, check, state, scope, and settings.
4. **Trusted-reference reachability** — the chosen reference exercises the run code path at easier scale.
5. **Hint quarantine** — old data, old figures, old plans never serve as evidence.

Severity tags (non-exhaustive): `covered`, `missing-route`, `plan-gap`, `stale-dependency`, `provenance-gap`, `weak-reference`, `hint-leak`.

### `script`

Compare the script against the protocol and the cited methodology section.

1. **Claim coverage** — script produces evidence for every assigned claim.
2. **Route match** — imports, commands, entrypoints, manifests, and generated artifacts match each declared cell's `method`, `stack`, `route`, `source`, `check`, `state`, and `scope`.
3. **Stack-claim match** — the script's actual imports and library calls match the declared `stack`. A `stack = "quspin"` cell whose compute uses raw `scipy.linalg.eigh` is a silent drift, not a passing audit.
4. **Deviation honesty** — every difference from the paper, method card, selected stack, or route check is recorded as a deviation.
5. **Manifest provenance** — script writes the fields required by `exists`/`agree`/`fresh`/`support` checks and registers evidence artifacts with the producer role required by the protocol.
6. **Regime support** — budgets and knobs are sufficient for the declared checks, not just plausible-looking numbers.
7. **Figure-reading checklist** — for any script that contributes to a figure (cell runner OR assembly code): work through the [Figure-reading checklist](#figure-reading-checklist) against the paper caption. Quote the caption text and match each plotted quantity to a paper-stated definition. "Math looks right" is not a verdict.

Severity tags (non-exhaustive): `match`, `proxy`, `route-mismatch`, `stack-drift`, `unrecorded-deviation`, `provenance-gap`, `regime-gap`, `caption-misread`, `axis-mismatch`, `state-mismatch`, `window-mismatch`.

### `result`

1. **R1. Numeric agreement per claim** — check by: for each numerical claim, ✓ within paper's error bar, ⚠ outside paper but within convergence margin, ✗ disagrees.
2. **R2. Figure-caption checklist** — check by: work through the [Figure-reading checklist](#figure-reading-checklist) against the assembled image and the paper caption. Off-by-an-L-factor, wrong-state-pick, and wrong-window are common silent failures invisible from the numbers alone; the audit must catch them visually and from the script.
3. **R3. Manifest provenance + current_run evidence** — check by: confirm each result artifact is `current_run` evidence with manifest route fields matching the protocol cell.
4. **R4. Hash match against current registration** — check by: confirm each result artifact's hash matches its current registration.

### `mismatch`

Audit a failed gate. Input: the failing check, expected vs observed, protocol, source passages, scripts, manifests, prior repair attempt.

1. **Observed-vs-expected mismatch** — concrete disagreement with cited artifacts.
2. **Mismatch class** — `source_misread`, `unsupported_assumption`, `convention_mismatch`, `plan_gap`, `script_bug`, `stack_or_remote_failure`, `stale_or_provenance_gap`, `insufficient_convergence`, `statistical_noise`, `paper_ambiguity`, `out_of_scope`.
3. **Earliest wrong layer** — source/protocol, trusted reference, plan/run spec, script/aggregator, stack, raw cells, figure/report, or paper scope.
4. **Invalidation scope** — downstream gates that can no longer support claims.
5. **Repair row** — the next accepted artifact records the repair with invalidated gates and rerun state.

Severity tags (non-exhaustive): `classified`, `under-evidenced`, `source-layer`, `plan-layer`, `script-layer`, `compute-layer`, `assembly-layer`, `report-layer`, `scope-layer`.

### `close`

Audit the final run report, declared entry, protocol, verification reports, and manifest set.

1. **Claim boundedness** — every report claim maps to a protocol claim, a result artifact, and a verify report.
2. **Artifact provenance** — manifests carry required hashes, claim ids, deviation ids, method, stack, route, check, state, and scope.
3. **Gate closure** — every flow gate is `passed` (or the run is marked partial / has recorded overrides).
4. **Deviation visibility** — declared differences from the paper appear in the report, linked to protocol deviations.
5. **Repair closure** — each `[[repairs]]` row lists invalidated gates, and those gates have fresh passing attempts after the repair.
6. **Reproducibility** — declared entry + run command sufficient for fresh checkout.
7. **Audience-facing artifact** — when a `report_*.html` is in scope: every editorial sentence in `editorial.json` traces to its `sourced_by` (re-grep the cited file:line); rendered HTML conforms to `docs/DESIGN.md`; mobile rendering at 375×667 has no overflow and ≥ 44×44px tap targets.

Severity tags (non-exhaustive): `supported`, `unsupported-claim`, `hint-leak`, `stale-artifact`, `provenance-gap`, `open-gate`, `hidden-deviation`, `open-repair`, `repro-gap`, `editorial-leak`, `design-drift`.

## Figure-reading checklist

Per AGENTS.md → Pre-compute figure-reading checklist (caption verbatim, axes + scale, y-normalization, per-curve identity, state-selection contract, window, anchors, NOT). Referenced from `script` axis 7 and `result` axis R2.

## Output

Two files, side by side:

1. **`<run-dir>/verify/verify_<artifact-stem>_<date>.md`** — human-readable per-axis findings.
2. **`<run-dir>/verify/verify_<artifact-stem>_<date>.toml`** — machine-readable verdict sidecar consumed by `flow attempt finish` and surfaced in `flow status --json`. Renderers read claim verdicts from here, never by grepping the markdown.

The sidecar has a top-level gate status plus one `[[verdicts]]` entry per claim the audit voted on.

<rule name="sidecar-gating">
Top-level `status` controls the audit gate: only `pass` passes. Per-claim `status` controls rendered claim chips. `note` is optional.
</rule>

| Sidecar `status` | Markdown glyph |
|---|---|
| `pass` | ✓ |
| `warn` | ⚠ |
| `fail` | ✗ |

```toml
status = "pass"      # pass | warn | fail
mode = "protocol"    # protocol | plan | kb-card | script | result | mismatch | close
target = "protocol.toml"
hash = "sha256:..."  # optional, but required when target freshness matters
author = "codex:<author-session>"
reviewer = "subagent:<returned-id>"

[[verdicts]]
claim = "claim.scaling_exponent"
status = "pass"

[[verdicts]]
claim = "claim.universal_constant"
status = "warn"
note = "agrees within 2σ; paper's error bar tighter than ours"

[[verdicts]]
claim = "claim.critical_temperature"
status = "fail"
note = "disagrees by 4σ — see Axis 3"
```

The markdown carries the verbatim passages, the per-axis table, and the detail. It is what humans read:

```markdown
# /verify report — <artifact> — <date>

**Mode**: protocol | plan | kb-card | script | result | mismatch | close.
**Reference**: <path / lines>.

| Axis / Row | Status | Severity | Claim ids | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ... | ✓ / ⚠ / ✗ | ... | `fig4.shape, fig4.minimum` | ... |

## Detailed findings
### Axis N — <name>
... verbatim passage with line number, verbatim script snippet, conclusion ...
```

**No "Action items" section.** Translating findings into next-step options is the *calling skill's* job.

## Output handoff

The verifier produces findings ONLY. The calling skill translates findings into `AskUserQuestion` options. The verifier MUST NOT write Action items or Next steps sections.

## Discipline

- Inspection-only. Never modify the artifact.
- On ambiguity, MUST verdict ✗; never round up to ✓ on a "looks close" basis.
- For Analytic and Harness anchors, the tag is sufficient provenance.
- Generic over artifact type and reference. No artifact-specific logic.
- Dispatch invariants: see AGENTS.md → Audit dispatch (flow's `audit` check enforces actor distinctness mechanically).

## Composition

- Called by `/reproduce-paper` for protocol, plan, script, result, mismatch, and close audits.
- Called by `/report` for close-mode audit of the rendered HTML.
- Called by KB-card or script authors as a pre-commit gate.

See [Output handoff](#output-handoff) for the findings-only contract — the *calling skill* translates findings into 2–3 user options via the host's native API (`AskUserQuestion` in Claude Code; equivalent in Codex). User ratifies; only then does cleanup happen.

In a flow-backed run, the caller records this audit as an `audit`-kind attempt on the relevant gate, writes the markdown report and typed TOML sidecar, attaches the report path with `--report`, then `flow attempt finish`. Flow's `audit` check verifies actor distinctness, report/sidecar freshness, and top-level sidecar `status = "pass"`.

## Anti-patterns

- Modifying the artifact from inside this skill.
- Treating KB-sourced protocol claims as primary-source support.
- Treating old scripts, plans, data, or figures as evidence without current hashes.
- Adding paper- or domain-specific kind names to `[[checks]]`.
- Closing a final run report without a `close`-mode review.
- Single-line "looks fine" report — the structured per-axis table is the deliverable.
- Subagent prescribing fixes / writing an `## Action items` section.
- Audit dispatch contract violations: see AGENTS.md → Audit dispatch.
