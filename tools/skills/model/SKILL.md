description: |
  MUST invoke when user wants to solve, investigate, or reproduce any
  harness-tracked quantum lattice model. Supported (match user prose to one):
  - transverse-field-ising (TFIM): quantum-critical Ising chain / 2D Wilson-Fisher
  - heisenberg: SU(2) magnet, AFM or FM by sign of J
  - j1-j2: frustrated Heisenberg, J2/J1≈0.5 spin-liquid candidate
  - t-v: spinless fermions + NN repulsion (CDW vs Luttinger)
  - hubbard: t-U electrons; Mott transition, cuprate parent
  - t-j: strong-coupling Hubbard with no-double-occupancy
  - anderson-impurity (SIAM): impurity-in-bath, Kondo
  - multiorbital-hubbard: multi-band + Hund's J
  - spin-1-xxz: Haldane phase, AKLT
  - potts-clock: q-state, first-order / continuous / BKT by q
  For EVERY matched model, read knowledge-base/models/<name>/MODEL.md AND
  grep ^signal in knowledge-base/models/<name>/TACITS.toml before issuing
  any verdict. Do this for each model you touch, not just the first one
  matched in the session.

# model dispatcher

Auto-triggered. The user does not type `/model`; the description above fires
the skill when their prose names a harness-tracked model.

## Audience definition (binding)

<audience>
The reader is a working physicist with no harness-internal context. They
want the result with embedded reasoning (what method, why, what was
verified), not the agent's process. They do NOT know harness vocabulary
(subagent, manifest, attempt, gate, kind, override, deviation, flow,
producer). Every user-facing line is anchored to this audience.
</audience>

## Workflow

1. **Match.** Resolve user's prose to one canonical model name. Handle
   aliases (TFIM → transverse-field-ising, SIAM → anderson-impurity, …).
2. **Read the card.** `knowledge-base/models/<name>/MODEL.md` is
   authoritative; agent memory is not. Work through the following checklist
   before any compute:

   <checklist name="card-read">
   - Hamiltonian definition and sign/normalization conventions read
   - Declared phases and their order parameters identified
   - Observables and their canonical forms noted
   - Recommended method(s) and their stack noted
   - Verification rubric (limit / symmetry / convergence / cross-method) noted
   </checklist>

3. **Grep tacits (REQUIRED before compute).** Run `grep ^signal` on
   `knowledge-base/models/<name>/TACITS.toml` for every matched model. For
   each signal whose surface symptom matches your planned setup or
   anticipated error, read the full `[[tacit]]` block. Skipping this grep
   when a `TACITS.toml` exists is itself a failed step.

   Read every signal line before deciding which is relevant. Filtering
   happens after reading, not before — a signal you dismiss as "probably
   not it" but whose symptom matches has cost the harness real compute in
   prior sessions.

4. **Execute.** Follow the card's declared workflow. The card names which
   primitive skills to compose (`/solve`, `/parameter-scan`, `/verify`,
   `/scaling-fit`, `/cross-method-check`, `/slurm`, `/reproduce-paper`). Do
   NOT substitute a different primitive because it feels more familiar; the
   card's choice is authoritative.

5. **Report.** Three lines or fewer in prose: primary quantity (value +
   units), verification status (which checks passed), and one-line
   reasoning (method + why). Auto-generate and embed the relevant
   convergence or stability plot — never report a result without the visual
   proof it converged.

## Anti-patterns

<checklist name="anti-patterns">
- Substituting generic ED/DMRG defaults for the card's declared workflow — fail.
- Acting on agent memory ("I remember Heisenberg has 3 phases") instead of re-reading the card — fail. Memory drifts; cards don't.
- Ignoring `TACITS.toml` signals when the audited artifact's symptom matches — fail.
</checklist>

<example name="memory-substitution bad">
"Heisenberg has 3 phases — AFM, FM, and PM — so I'll measure ⟨S·S⟩ and ⟨Sᶻ⟩."
</example>

<example name="memory-substitution good">
"Re-reading knowledge-base/models/heisenberg/MODEL.md before naming phases. The card declares [list from card]; observables [list from card]."
</example>
