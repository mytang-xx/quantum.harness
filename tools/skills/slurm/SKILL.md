description: Use when a computation needs to run on a remote Slurm cluster (CPU- or GPU-heavy beyond laptop budget), when a multi-cell array job is ready to submit, when a submitted job needs status / monitoring / cancel / log-tail, or when only a few cells failed and the user wants to resume — phrases like "send this to the cluster", "sbatch this", "submit on HPC2", "check job status", "resubmit failed cells".

# slurm

Submit and monitor Slurm jobs from the local agent via `ssh`, `rsync`/`git`, `sbatch`, `squeue`, and `sacct`. Mechanism only: no cluster-side agent, no MCP server, no manual user relay.

For parameter grids, compose with `/parameter-scan`. `/parameter-scan` owns cell decomposition; `/slurm` submits the resulting job or array.

## Binding Rules

<checklist name="binding">
- Pre-checks must pass before submit: readable cluster profile, `ssh <alias> echo ok`, and captured local `git status --porcelain`.
- Dirty worktree shipping requires user authorization. Do not silently commit, push, or rsync user changes.
- Partition choice is ratified after queue probing. Do not blindly use the profile default when alternatives are viable.
- Scheduler state is not scientific evidence. `sbatch` success, `squeue COMPLETED`, and `ssh` exit status do not close reproduction claims; fetched manifests do.
- Array jobs receive an opaque run spec and write one manifest per cell. `/slurm` never parses or hardcodes axis names.
</checklist>

## Inputs

- *Script* — sbatch script or compute script plus the active cluster profile's array template.
- *Cluster profile* — `tools/cluster/active.md` or `HARNESS_CLUSTER_PROFILE=<name>`, providing ssh alias, remote repo path, scheduler idioms, partitions, modules, queue commands.
- *Software stack* — optional stack id/profile from `tools/skills/<stack>/stack.toml`.
- *Cell map* — optional `results/<run>/run_spec.json`.
- *Ship strategy* — `git` or `rsync`.

## Workflow

1. **Pre-check.** Resolve profile, test ssh, capture dirty status.
2. **Probe and ratify partition.** Inspect queue state and present 2-3 viable options with recommended first.
3. **Bootstrap only if needed.** Ensure remote repo and declared stack are usable; dispatch `/setup-julia` only for Julia commands when Julia is not ready.
4. **Ship.** Use authorized `git` flow or explicit `rsync`.
5. **Submit.** Run `sbatch` on the remote repo and capture job id, partition, walltime, and cell count.
6. **Monitor.** Check pending/running transitions, startup logs, and long-run pulses. If the job remains pending or fails at startup, surface choices rather than waiting silently.
7. **Fetch.** On completion, sync `results/<run>/` back locally.
8. **Diagnose.** Use `sacct` plus per-cell artifacts to classify success, OOM, walltime, logic failure, and convergence-out-of-budget.
9. **Hand back.** Print per-cell status table and local results path.

## Cluster Profile

Consult the active profile from `tools/cluster/active.md` or
`HARNESS_CLUSTER_PROFILE=<name>` before submission. Required fields:

- `ssh.alias`, `repo_path_remote`
- scheduler type and default queue
- partitions table
- login/compute internet availability
- region for mirror defaults
- `bootstrap_one_time`
- sbatch idioms
- queue/status commands

If no profile exists, emit a generic array wrapper without resource directives
and recommend `/onboard` cluster setup. Do not invent partitions, CPUs, memory,
or walltime.

## Partition Ratification

Probe before choosing:

```bash
ssh <alias> 'sinfo -o "%P %a %.10l %.6D %.6t"'
```

Filter candidate partitions by the calling skill's resource hint: CPU, GPU,
high-memory, multi-node, etc. Present 2-3 real options with:

- partition name
- current load: idle/mix/alloc/down
- cores/memory/GPU specs
- expected queue wait
- one-line pro/con

Recommended first, but alternatives must be real. Submission uses the ratified
partition.

## First-run Bootstrap

Run only when needed:

- Test whether `<repo_path_remote>` exists. If absent, clone or stage according to the profile.
- Inspect the selected stack contract in `tools/skills/<stack>/stack.toml`.
- For `language = "julia"`, ensure Julia is usable first; call `/setup-julia --target remote:<alias>` only when needed.
- Run the stack smoke test in the declared place. `where = "login"` can run by ssh; `where = "compute"` needs a scheduler allocation.
- Apply cluster `bootstrap_one_time` snippets once and write a `~/.harness-bootstrapped` marker.

GPU NetKet or CUDA/JAX device tests are compute-node tests, not login-node tests.

## Shipping

`git` strategy:

1. Capture dirty status.
2. With user authorization, stage/commit/push.
3. Remote: `git fetch`, checkout branch, pull.

`rsync` strategy:

```bash
rsync -avz --exclude='/results' --exclude='/.git' . <alias>:<repo>/
```

Use rsync for fast iteration only when the user understands it bypasses git
history.

## Submit

Single job:

```bash
ssh <alias> "cd <repo> && sbatch <script>"
```

Array job:

- Sync `run_spec.json` first.
- Use `sbatch --array=1-N --export=ALL,HARNESS_RUN_SPEC=<path>,HARNESS_COMMAND='<command>' ...`.
- `HARNESS_ENTRYPOINT=<script>` is a convenience fallback for executable scripts and Julia entrypoints.

## Monitoring Discipline

Settle-time checks are ordered:

1. **Pending to running.** Within 1-3 min after `sbatch`, re-check `squeue -j <jid>`. If still pending, read the reason and surface options.
2. **Startup health.** Within 1-3 min after first `RUNNING`, tail at least one log to confirm actual compute has started.
3. **Long-run pulse.** For multi-hour jobs, poll every 30-60 min and tail one log periodically.

Pending reasons:

- `Priority`, `Resources`, `BeginTime` — queued; show queue depth and offer wait/switch/stop.
- `AssocMaxJobsLimit`, `QOSMaxJobsPerUserLimit` — account/quota throttle; waiting may not help.
- `Dependency` — verify dependency exists and is intended.

Do not report "submitted = computing" while a job is pending.

## Utilization Inspection

A process-row `%CPU = 100` in `top` means one core's worth of instantaneous CPU,
not full node utilization. Inspect threads:

```text
cat /proc/<pid>/status | grep -E '^(Threads|Cpus_allowed_list)'
ps -L -p <pid> -o tid,psr,pcpu,stat
top -H -b -n 1 -p <pid>
```

Interpret aggregate `%CPU` as cores worth of work: `234%` is about 2.34 cores. For
serial bottlenecks, partial spread can be normal; do not cancel from one
snapshot.

## Fetch and Diagnose

After completion:

```bash
rsync -avz <alias>:<repo>/results/<run>/ results/<run>/
sacct -j <jobid> --format=JobID,State,ExitCode,MaxRSS,Elapsed
```

Classify every cell:

```text
cell_id | state | exit-code | maxRSS | elapsed | classification
```

Do not collapse cells of the same class; the calling workflow needs exact
failed cells.

## Array Contract

Every array job receives `HARNESS_RUN_SPEC=<results/run/run_spec.json>` plus one of `HARNESS_CELL_ID`, `HARNESS_CELL_INDEX`, or Slurm's `$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID`. The script reads the selected cell's opaque `params` and writes:

```text
results/<run>/cells/<cell_id>/manifest.json
```

The manifest schema belongs to the calling workflow/method card. `/slurm` only submits, monitors, fetches, and classifies operational state.

## Resume

- Re-submit only cells without a success-tagged manifest.
- Failed cells require user ratification before retry.
- If the cell map changes, start a new run id.

## Output

- Job record: job id, sbatch command, partition, walltime, ship strategy, cell count.
- Final job state: completed/failed/timeout, runtime, peak memory per cell when available.
- Local results path: `results/<run>/`.
- Per-cell table: `cell_id | state | exit-code | maxRSS | elapsed | classification`.
- 2-3-line report with success/fail counts and the recommended next step.

## Composition

- `/parameter-scan` calls `/slurm` once for array sweeps.
- `/reproduce-paper` calls `/slurm` through evidence-producing primitives.
- `/onboard` creates the cluster profile this skill reads.
- `/setup-julia` is called only from first-run bootstrap when the submitted command requires Julia and Julia is not usable.

## Anti-patterns

<checklist name="reject">
- Asking the user to ssh or sbatch manually when this skill can do it.
- Hardcoding cluster specifics into this skill.
- Submitting via an unvetted cluster-side service.
- Bundling parameter-grid logic into `/slurm`.
- Silent commits, pushes, or broad rsync of dirty local changes.
</checklist>
